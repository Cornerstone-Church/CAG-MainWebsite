            <h1>Our Vision for Missions</h1>
            <p>
                Missions, at home and abroad, is a foundational part of who we are as a church. This commitment extends
                to our 300 plus missionaries and ministries and more than 105 countries through financial support, as
                well as prayer and personal encouragement. We desire for our heart to match the heartbeat of God for the
                lost and hurting around the world. The purpose of this “Strategy for World Ministries” is to articulate
                God’s clear direction regarding missions for our church. We pray this strategy will help steer our
                future direction and bridge our calling to future church generations.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h2>Principle 1: Prayer is Paramount</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Lord has shown us that prayer is, and must continue to be, the primary gift we give to
                        missions. Prayer connects the hearts of people within the local church to the heart of God and
                        His love for the world. We understand that nothing of eternal value happens without prayer.

                        <br><br>“I believe it will only be know on the Last Day how much has been accomplished in
                        missionary
                        work by the prayers of earnest believers at home.. I do earnestly covet a volume of prayer for
                        myself and the work-but who will give this?” James Fraser
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Principle 2: Increasingly Affect the World for Jesus Christ</h2>
                    <p>
                        We will continue monthly support to an ever-increasing staff of missionaries locally and
                        globally. Our first consideration for support will be to missionaries and world missions that
                        are accountable to the Assemblies of God World Ministries, although we will reach out to others
                        as the Lord allows. We will not limit the number of missionaries the Lord would have us support,
                        but we will continue to encourage “new harvesters” with monthly commitments in prayer and
                        finances. This will:
                        <br><br>- Keep our focus on Christ’s teaching to ask the Lord of the Harvest to send forth
                        laborers into
                        His harvest.
                        <br>- Keep our congregation from becoming complacent in “our” accomplishments by continually
                        encouraging us to provide for the needs of the world.

                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Principle 3: Build Relationships</h2>
                    <p>
                        We will continue to partner and build personal relationships from within our missionary staff.
                        We will develop at least one key partnership in North America, Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin
                        America and Oceania. Currently, we have partners in China, Ecuador, Japan, several nations in
                        the middle East and North Africa, India, Moldova, Nepal, Philippines, Senegal, and Uzbekistan to
                        name a few. We will continue to build close relationships with a limited number of our
                        missionaries and their families. This will:
                        <br><br>- Foster long-term relationships and influence in different areas of the world.
                        <br>- Influence different areas of the world in a more substantial way.
                        <br>- Provide relational benefits for the missionary family and our church family accomplished
                        through ongoing prayer and monthly contact with each of our missionary staff. These partnerships
                        will have a higher priority for funding beyond monthly support. If these servants change
                        locations or area of ministry, we will ask the Lord for His direction in order to continue to
                        impact every continent. These partnerships will not restrict us from helping meet other needs
                        that may arise on a short term or one-time basis.
                        <br><br>Missionaries-in-Residence – As we are able, we will offer housing to specific
                        missionaries while
                        they are itinerating. While they are with us, we will do our best to make them feel like part of
                        the church. We will give the missionaries-in-residence and their family a place to connect and a
                        strong base of support.

                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Principle 4: Show Compassion</h2>
                    <p>
                        As a church family, we will provide one-time or ongoing support in emergency situations as
                        natural disasters, war, calamities, and other special needs. This will:
                        <br><br>- Allow us to be His instruments of compassion at critical moments in regions of the
                        world that
                        need His touch.
                        <br>- Open doors to evangelism through a practical expression of God’s love.
                        <br><br>Ministries that serve as our conduit in critical moments and ongoing areas of need
                        include
                        Convoy of Hope, Disaster Relief, Healthcare Ministries, Mercy Ships, and Project Rescue, just to
                        name a few.

                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Principle 5: Distribute the Word of God & Disciple the Nations</h2>
                    <p>
                        We will aid in giving the Bible to every human being. Distributing the written Word, whether
                        print or digital, will allow the Gospel to be spread with great speed and even greater results.
                        In addition, we will support Global University and Bible colleges and universities across the
                        globe. We will support the distribution of Bibles, tracts and other literature through the Fire
                        Bible, Light for the Lost, Bible Alliance, the International Bible Society and Boys and Girls
                        Missionary Challenge (BGMC).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Principle 6: Reaching the Unreached</h2>
                    <p>
                        We will be intentional about reaching people in our world who have not heard the message of
                        Jesus. We will focus prayer, attention, and resources to those thousands of tribal and language
                        groups who have not had a witness of Jesus. With God’s help, we will do our part to touch the
                        “unreached” wherever they are and however we can. We will not neglect currently supported places
                        and partnership but will strive to reach the unreached and the never reached, in every way
                        possible.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Principle 7: Involve Our Entire Church Body</h2>
                    <p>
                        We will seek to have EVERYONE who calls Cornerstone their home church participate in World
                        Ministries in some capacity. This will:
                        <br><br>- Help everyone in our body focus on Christ and His great commission.
                        <br>- Help individuals and families form long-term personal relationships with missionaries, which
                        will reap great benefits for all.
                        <br>- Raise up a new generation of young people who understand missions.
                        <br><br>We will accomplish this through several key initiatives, such as prayer for the lost and for
                        missionaries at all age levels within the church and through personal interaction with
                        missionaries on a regular basis. We will encourage our congregation to pray for them at weekly
                        gatherings and prayer meetings. We will give opportunity for people of all ages to respond to
                        the call to missions by encouraging mission participation through prayer, financially resourcing
                        and going on short-term and long-term mission trips. We will ask God to raise up new harvesters
                        from within Cornerstone Church who will be sent out to serve locally and globally. This will
                        increase missions awareness within the church and keep it at the forefront of what Cornerstone
                        is all about.
