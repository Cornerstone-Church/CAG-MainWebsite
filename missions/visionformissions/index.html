            <h1>Our Vision for Missions</h1>
            <br>
            <div class="center">
                <h2>"One Church Can Change the World"</h2>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
                Partnering in missions is how we as a local church work to establish the global Church among all people,
                at home and abroad.
                We currently partner with 300 plus missionaries and ministries in more than 105 countries and hope to
                expand our partnership even further as God enables.
                Our strategy for partnership in missions is guided by 7 principles:

            </p>
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h2>Principle 1: We Will Pray</h2>
                    <p>
                        Prayer is, and must continue to be, the primary gift we give to missions since it connects the
                        church to the heart of God and His love for the world, and nothing of eternal value happens
                        without prayer.

                    <div class="center">
                        "Every great movement of God can be traced to a kneeling figure." -D.L. Moody
                    </div>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Principle 2: We Will Increasingly Affect the World For Jesus Christ</h2>
                    <p>
                        We will not limit the number of missionaries the Lord would have us partner with, but we will
                        continue to encourage new workers with monthly commitments in prayer and finances, giving first
                        consideration to Assemblies of God missionaries and ministries, and extending partnership to
                        others as the Lord allows.

                    <div class="center">"The mark of a great church is not its seating capacity, but it's sending
                        capacity." -Mike
                        Stachura</div>

                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Principle 3: We Will Build Relationships</h2>
                    <p>
                        We will develop strategic, long-term, mutually-beneficial relationships among our missionary
                        staff. Our desire is to have at least one key partnership in every region of the world. While
                        these partnerships will have a higher priority for funding beyond monthly support, they will not
                        restrict us from helping meet other needs that may arise on a short term or one-time basis.
                        Additionally, we will also offer housing, a place to serve, and relational support to missionary
                        staff on itineration who we will invite to serve as Missionaries-in-Residence.

                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Principle 4: We Will Reach the Unreached</h2>
                    <p>
                        We will intentionally give focused attention, prayer, and resources toward establishing the
                        church among those thousands of tribal and language groups who have not had a witness of the
                        gospel, and among whom the indigenous church either does not yet exist or is not yet mature
                        enough to do the work of mission.

                    <div class="center">"Lost people matter to God, and so they must matter to us." -Keith Wright</div>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Principle 5: We Will Show Compassion</h2>
                    <p>
                        Believing that God cares for the whole person - body, mind, and spirit - we will provide support
                        as instruments of His holistic compassion when natural disasters, war, calamities, and other
                        special needs may arise.

                    <div class="center">"Do you know that nothing you do in this life will ever matter, unless it is
                        about loving God
                        and loving the people He has made?" -Francis Chan</div>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Principle 6: We Will Distribute the Word of God and Disciple the Nations</h2>
                    <p>
                        Believing that “faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God” (Rom. 10:17), we will
                        aid in presenting the Bible in print, audio, visual and digital forms to every human being.

                    <div class="center">“If Jesus Christ be God, and died for me, then no sacrifice can be too great
                        from me to make for
                        Him.” -C. T. Studd</div>

                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Principle 7: We Will Involve Our Entire Church Body</h2>
                    <p>
                        We want everyone who calls Cornerstone their home church to participate in missions in some way.
                        Church-wide participation in mission increases the focus on Christ and His commission. It
                        facilitates personal relationships with missionaries that yield long-term benefits for all, and
                        aides in raising up a new generation that loves and understands missions. We will give
                        opportunity for people of all ages to respond to the call to missions by encouraging
                        participation in prayer, giving, and serving on mission trips, as well as asking God to raise up
                        new missionaries from within Cornerstone Church to be sent out to serve locally and globally.
                    </p>
