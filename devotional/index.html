                    Readings: Gen. 3: 23-24 (NIV); Romans 5:18-19 (ESV); Rev 5: 1-10; Rev 7: 9-11: Rev 19:1-8
                    <br><br>
                    The heart of God beats to dwell in fellowship with every man and woman. He craves the presence of
                    his creation which is made in His image and has been given His breath to live. Adam and Eve had the
                    lavish privilege of walking with God; we have the humble privilege of God dwelling in us. God
                    desires a deep, flourishing, fruitful relationship with his people. He has specifically crafted
                    every detail of our being to place us in a position to receive all he has designed so we can live a
                    life of godliness.
                    <br><br>
                    The heart of God broke when the seed of Eve and Adam’s doubt quickly produced the fruit of their
                    disobedience finalizing their banishment from God’s presence (Genesis 3:23-24). Can you imagine the
                    sorrow of God’s heart? Perhaps you are close to a child and desire to give great and good gifts, but
                    their disobedience prevents the rewards? Can you relate? Every good gift was stolen from man: the
                    fellowship, the joy, and the intimate relationship. God is forever the same. His heart beats for
                    fellowship with man so he created a restoration process for all nations, all people, all tribes, and
                    all languages. “Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of
                    righteousness leads to justification and life for all men. For as by the one man’s disobedience the
                    many were made sinners, so by the one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous.” (Romans
                    5:18-19)
                    <br><br>
                    The heart of God rejoices in the Lamb, the restorer of the disobedient. John the Revelator reports
                    that the Lamb of God (Christ) is the only one worthy to open the scrolls because he was slain to
                    ransom all people, all nations, all tribes, and all languages reversing the curse of banishment into
                    the gift of fellowship with God. The blood of Christ purchased a multitude of men (Rev 5:1-10). A
                    receipt is given to each believer stamped in Christ’s blood reading, “PAID IN FULL”.
                    <br><br>
                    The heart of God is unfulfilled, until all have heard, there is still work to be done. We live
                    between two realities: the past of disobedience and the future of celebration. We live in the
                    reality that there are NOT YET the multitude from every nation, tribe, people, and language singing
                    praise around the throne (Rev 7:9-11). In every country of this world, including our own, there are
                    people waiting to hear for the first time that Redemption is a reality through Jesus Christ.
                    <br><br>
                    Take-away: The heart of God beats for an intimate, personal, flourishing relationship with each
                    individual that has breath.
                    <br><br>
                    Reflection: How can I make myself more available to go to the nations so they can live in the
                    reality that Christ has reconciled them to God, no longer living under the punishment of banishment?
                    How can I help bring the heartbeat of God to a nation, a tribe, a people, or a language?
                    <br><br>
                    Prayer:
                    <br>
                    Dear Lord Jesus, thank you for ransoming yourself so that I may be reconciled to God. Thank you for
                    providing an open avenue to have an intimate, flourishing, fruitful relationship with God through
                    your blood and empowered by the Holy Spirit. Thank you that I have received the receipt, “Paid in
                    Full”. Lord, today, I make myself available for you to use. I will be obedient to you in what you
                    ask of me. I will go wherever, whenever, and to whomever you ask of me. I will be obedient to do
                    whatever is necessary to see other nations, people, tribes, and languages to have the same
                    opportunity to know you as I have had. I want to be a part of sharing your good news so when I stand
                    around your throne shouting, “Salvation belongs to our God…” (Rev 7:10a) I will stand with the
                    uncountable multitude from every nation – every tribe. In Jesus name, Amen.

                <div class="devo-title">Touching Our World: Part 1</div>
                <div class="devo-author">Dick Brogden</div>
                <p>
                    There is one primary way to compassionately touch the world, and it is not popular. If in all things
                    we take our cues for Jesus we must respond in compassion as He did not as is convenient for us.
                    <br><br>
                    In Matthew 9:35 Jesus was going through cities and villages teaching, proclaiming the gospel, and
                    healing every kind of sickness and disease. Surrounded by human need and brokenness we are told
                    (9:36) that Jesus was moved with compassion for the people were distressed and dispirited. His
                    response is telling. We respond to compassion by immediately thinking about social needs (which are
                    real and pressing). When we see human distress and need, sickness and demonization, we think of
                    programs, projects, and psychologists. Which is not where Jesus went first. Seeing all the human
                    tragedy around Him, here was the response of God made flesh: The harvest is plentiful but the
                    workers are few. Therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into the harvest.
                    (9:37)
                    <br><br>
                    Lest there be any doubt to the surprising reaction of Jesus to social need, the whole next chapter
                    (Matthew 10) contains details about the missionary mandate to Jesus’ followers. They are given
                    instructions on how and where to proclaim the gospel. Simply put, the compassion of Jesus led Him to
                    pray for missionaries and then to send them out. Strategically the compassion of Jesus is far to
                    wise too fixate on a few short years and very concerned about the eternal soul.
                    If we want to be compassionate (as Jesus was) we will pray for laborers and send them out to win
                    souls, make disciples, and plant churches. If we want to be compassionate in the truncated
                    understanding of the world we will focus on social action.
                    <br><br>
                    To be clear we do have a secondary mandate to address sociological, environmental, judicial, and
                    practical fallenness of our world but it’s not the priority of Jesus. The single eye focus of Jesus
                    is the saving of souls and eternal life. If we bear the name of Jesus we must share the same greater
                    love – a passion for eternal cure and joy. All temporal service (noble and necessary as it is) is
                    then means not ends. Why do drill wells? So souls may be saved. Why do we feed the hungry? So souls
                    may be saved. Why do we rescue those sold to sexual slavery? So souls may be saved. Why do we care
                    for orphans, widows, and the marginalized? So souls will be saved.
                    <br><br>
                    The Bible is so very clear about our priority. At the end of Matthew we are told to make disciples
                    of all people groups. At the end of Mark we are told to preach the gospel to every creature. At the
                    end of Luke we are told that forgiveness of sins will be preached in the name of Jesus to every
                    people. At the end of John we are told we will be sent in the same way Jesus was sent (away from
                    home to suffer and die for the sins of all people). In the beginning of Acts we are told to leave
                    home and take the gospel to the uttermost parts of the earth. How do we touch the world? We do what
                    Jesus told us, we prioritize what He prioritized. We look out with compassion at human brokenness,
                    we fall down on our knees and pray for missionaries to be sent out, we rise up and with all our
                    energy send those missionaries to the end of the earth, those missionaries use every means of
                    service to lift up their voices to make disciples and plant churches. The Jesus way is not popular,
                    but in the end it is much more compassionate.

                <div class="devo-title">Lifting Up Jesus: Part 3</div>
                <div class="devo-author">Dick Brogden</div>
                <p>
                    Because Jesus is the supreme beauty and goodness of eternity, it is altogether appropriate that
                    everything we do exalts Him, lifts Him up. Strange it is then to read the verse: “Humble yourself in
                    the sight of the Lord and He will lift you up.” (James 4:10) The humble part is to be expected, but
                    to what end are we lifted up when the supreme goal is to lift up Jesus?
                    <br><br>
                    I have long interpreted the phrase “in the sight of the Lord” from the understanding of rising to
                    God’s perspective to look down on how small I am. This view always has been accompanied with
                    discomfort as it seemed to require some measure of focus on “me” when the whole principle seemed to
                    require a solitary on Jesus. But what if “the sight of the Lord” has nothing to do with looking at
                    myself from God’s perspective (from His sight) but rather just continuing to look at Him?
                    <br><br>
                    When we stand looking up at a redwood, we automatically become aware of scope. When we stand gazing
                    in wonder at a mountain range, we automatically understand grandeur. How much more is the principle
                    true for fixing our eyes on Jesus. When we stand looking up at Him, we are automatically humbled.
                    Looking at ourselves (even from God’s perspective) is still looking at ourselves – but when we lift
                    up our eyes to Jesus, when our sight is on the Lord, we assume our rightful place. C.S. Lewis put it
                    this way: Humility is not thinking of ourselves less, it is not thinking of ourselves at all.
                    <br><br>
                    There are two forms of pride – one is to puff up and make ourselves something more than we are, and
                    the other is to shrink back and make ourselves less than we were created to be. Both result from
                    looking at ourselves – whether downward from God’s perspective or upward from the perspectives of
                    others who admire us (or to whom we compare ourselves favorably). When we are focused on “the sight
                    of the Lord” we neither shrink back or puff up, rather we stand our sacred ground.
                    <br><br>
                    And what is that sacred ground? To gaze at Jesus and be transfixed by His glory, to point at Him
                    with glee, to lift up our voice so that the nations can hear us exclaim: “O Magnify the Lord with
                    me, and let us exalt His name together!” No one looks at us – they all look at who we point to. No
                    one lifts us up – they all fix their eyes on He whim we exalt. We don’t in that sense humble nor
                    magnify ourselves, for when the Lord is in our sight all things take their proper place. It is in
                    the sight of the Lord (in looking at Jesus and exalting Him) that we are humbled, not in some
                    twisted distortion of ourselves.
                    <br><br>
                    And the lift to ourselves that God promises when we fix our sight on Him? It is just to see Him
                    better so we can better shout His praise. The principle endures – God only magnifies our voice so
                    that more people can direct their attention to Him, that unreached peoples who have for millennia
                    focused on themselves may lift up their eyes with us at all the grandeur of God. Humbling ourselves
                    in the sight of the Lord is not assuming His place in self review, it is self-forgetfulness as we
                    stare in wonder at Jesus, and our staring draws the attention of all men to Him.

                <div class="devo-author">Overturf</div>
                <p>
                    Spend much time with people and what they care about is evident--for those that are really
                    passionate about something, it's obvious! Do those around us know how much we love Jesus and
                    celebrate our salvation? Perhaps the bigger question to ask is, do we?
                    <br><br>
                    While there are many ways we can lift up Jesus, let's focus on 2.
                    1 Thessalonians 5:18 says: "Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God's will for you in
                    Christ Jesus." Giving thanks is a key as we look to lift up Jesus. Living in the reality that there
                    is ALWAYS something we can give thanks for us a great place to begin. As we begin to purposefully
                    look at each situation for how we can give thanks to the Lord, Jesus opens our eyes. We begin to see
                    His fingerprints in others, in situations, and even in ourselves. As we look to give thanks, it
                    begins to increasingly flow forth in our speech and shines in our countenance. As this happens, we
                    find we are lifting up Jesus--acknowledging Him in the good and hard circumstances alike. This
                    thanksgiving is rivers of Living Water. Other believers are encouraged as they are reminded of the
                    goodness of Jesus and a longing is awakened in non believers. The peace and joy we get to live in,
                    is deeper than circumstance and has no counterpart in the world.
                    <br><br>
                    This naturally leads us to the 2nd way toward lifting up Christ and that is to think of ourselves
                    less. When we don't see ourselves as the source, then we aren't looking for the credit. This
                    practice of giving thanks keeps us in the appropriate position of being aware that all we have is
                    from him and without him we can do nothing. Whatever we are able to offer results in pointing to
                    Christ.
                    <br><br>
                    C.S. Lewis says: “Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less." Oh
                    Jesus, help us grow in the grace of self forgetfulness! Our wants and desires secondary to what is
                    on His heart. There is such freedom when our prayer echoes John "He must become greater, I must
                    become less" (John 3:30). As he increases in us, he is lifted up, we begin to treasure Jesus more
                    and our joy grows. This thinking of ourselves less does not come naturally, but as we practice this
                    discipline, it's a muscle that strengthens with time and practice! A great place to begin is simply
                    asking Jesus to help us treasure him more.
                    <br><br>
                    To make much of Jesus is to make less of ourselves. To make much of Jesus is to see and point out
                    all His goodness to ourselves and those around us. To lift up Jesus is what we will do for all of
                    eternity---BUT ONLY NOW can it influence others that they can join us and know salvation. We lift
                    him up, and like a moth to a flame, those who don't know Jesus are drawn to the light of his love.
                    While we have time on earth, may we spend ourselves lifting up Jesus that others will come.... and
                    then we will continue that celebration for all of eternity.

                    Those who know me well, know that I am a sleepwalker. I have slept walk since I was a kid and
                    continue to do so, but less frequently.
                    <br><br>
                    My parents, college roommates, friends, and my wife can all tell you a story or two of how Aaron got
                    up in the middle of the night and started doing something out of the ordinary. They could tell you
                    stories of me eating breakfast at 3AM, hiding in the closet, taking care of sick patients, or moving
                    furniture while I was in a deep sleep. Actions and movements, but no real focus, motivation, value,
                    or purpose. It is truly amazing, and to be truthful, embarrassing the things I can do in my sleep
                    and not even remember it.
                    <br><br>
                    The story of King Asa in 2 Chronicles chapter 14-16 has frequently fascinated me. The King started
                    off so well and saw the miracles of God in his life. Specifically, Asa experienced God’s power and
                    intervention as he defeated a much larger and more powerful army. He truly witnessed a miracle.
                    <br><br>
                    However, as the story of his life went on, he seemingly began to rely more and more on himself
                    rather than God. He made plans and went through the motions, but without God’s guidance, direction,
                    and wisdom. I believe he became a “sleepwalker” of sorts. He was active, moving, and not necessarily
                    doing bad things, but he was not intentionally listening and following God’s voice and direction.
                    <br><br>
                    I have been on a journey the last six months praying, thinking, and processing how I can make sure
                    that I am not being a spiritual “sleepwalker.” I know that if I truly desire to follow and lift up
                    Jesus, I cannot fall into this trap of “sleepwalking” through life.
                    <br><br>
                    I believe one of the ways that we can prevent this “ sleepwalking” is by being intentional about
                    focusing, praying, and stewarding the natural talents, acquired abilities, spiritual gifts, and
                    spiritual disciplines that God has given each of us. When we ask God to give us the courage, wisdom,
                    and strength to walk in the confluence of these four things, it is amazing to see how He will open
                    up doors for us to lift up the name of Jesus.
                    <br><br>
                    So my challenge for you today is to take a few minutes and list:
                    <br><br>
                    Natural talents- the talents and gifting’s given to you when God created you. These would be
                    qualities that are innate or were with you from birth.
                    <br><br>
                    Acquired abilities- those things that you have acquired through training, education, and experience.
                    These abilities are areas you have developed over time through effort.
                    <br><br>
                    Spiritual giftings- these are endowments or special divine abilities that enable you to make our
                    specific contribution for the kingdom of God. They are not natural talents that you have had since
                    birth, but divine abilities given to you at salvation that enable you to minister to others.
                    <br><br>
                    Spiritual disciplines- these practices do not save you, but they are what saved people practice.
                    These disciplines help us walk and hear from God, and build up are character to support the natural
                    talents, acquired abilities, and spiritual gifttings.
                    <br><br>
                    My prayer for you today is that once you have clarified these, you will spend some significant time
                    asking God to give you opportunities to glorify and lift up the name of Jesus using your unique
                    giftings and talents so that you do not spend your life as a spiritual sleepwalker.

                <h2>Day 3</h2>
                <div class="devo-title">Listening Broadly like Jesus</div>
                <div class="devo-author">Santmyires</div>
                <p>
                    As we individually and corporately focus on lifting up Jesus, I believe that learning to listen
                    broadly like Jesus is vital.
                    In Mark 10:46-52, we see a fascinating account of Jesus interacting with Bartameus. We know this
                    story well. Bartameus was a blind man from Jericho who was sitting by the roadside. When he saw the
                    crowd and Jesus coming he began to cry out for Jesus to help him.
                    However, those who were in the crowd, those with Jesus, began to rebuke Bartameus. I do not believe
                    those with Jesus were bad or mean people, but their focus, at this moment, was not the same as Jesus
                    and His focus. The crowd was trying to silence Bartameus, and by doing so, directly or indirectly,
                    were implying that Jesus did not have time for a blind man like him.
                    Interestingly, Jesus stopped. He had them call for Bartameus. As you read this, please do not miss
                    this significant act. Jesus took time to Stop and Listen to a man to whom others were not willing to
                    Stop and Listen to. We are all busy and some of us really busy, but are we to busy, like the crowd
                    that was with Jesus, to stop and listen like Him?
                    <br><br>
                    One of the many fascinating characteristics about Jesus is that he modeled stopping and listening to
                    those the culture often rejected. This story of Bartameus is a great example of this. Jesus listened
                    to the poor, the stranger, the blind, the lame, and children. Jesus seemed to less frequently listen
                    to those that felt they had the right or social standing that required Jesus to stop and listen to
                    them. Jesus demonstrated the dignity, value, and importance of each person regardless of what the
                    culture or the world thought of them. Jesus values each person more than you and I will ever know.
                    As we endeavor to touch the world for Jesus, are we willing to stop and listen to the people that
                    Jesus listened to?
                    <br><br>
                    As we continue on in the story, we also see another important characteristic about listening broadly
                    like Jesus. Bartameus was now in front of Jesus, face to face, but Jesus did not say “it is obvious
                    that you are blind and want to be healed.” No. Jesus asked Bartameus what he wanted Him to do from
                    Him. Jesus wanted to know about Bartameus and what he valued before going forward.
                    <br><br>
                    I know I have often made the mistake of not stopping, asking, and listening to those around me, and
                    what they truly desiring and looking for. Maybe you have done the same, quickly trying to solve a
                    problem that the other person really is not looking for a solution to. I have done more than I wish
                    to admit.
                    As Christians, we can become prescriptive telling others what they need and why we have the answers
                    to their challenges, struggles, and difficulties, but Jesus, the Anointed One, modeled asking
                    Bartameus what he wanted. Are you willing to do the same and take the time to listen to what others
                    truly desire before beginning to tell them what they need?
                    <br><br>
                    My prayer for you today is that Jesus will bring those He loves across your path and that the Holy
                    Spirit will give you divine wisdom, boldness, and courage to stop, value others, and listen to them
                    as Jesus did.

                <div class="devo-title">We Were Made for This: Part 2</div>
                <div class="devo-author">Dick Brogden</div>
                <p>
                    God is a missionary God, the Bible is a missionary book, and we are to be His missionary people.
                    The Scriptures are organized around the supreme goal of God to be worshipped by every tribe, tongue,
                    people, and nation. When you have never heard that the whole point of human history is that God be
                    glorified it can be shocking and seem self-centered that God orchestrates all things to center on
                    Himself. What is problematic for anyone and anything else is supremely sensible for God – for He
                    alone is perfect beauty and sinless treasure. Who should God love more than Himself? Who should God
                    praise more than Himself? Who should we love more than God? Who should we praise more than God?
                    There is no one and nothing as good as God and He is worthy of all worship and adoration – further
                    we were created to be most fulfilled when we are most satisfied in Him. God’s glory and our
                    fulfillment are inescapably and wonderfully intertwined. We were made for this – we were made to
                    glorify God.
                    <br><br>
                    We were also made to share this deepest, eternal satisfaction with every people group on earth. The
                    Bible is organized on this conjoined satisfaction and sharing. The tripartite formula that organizes
                    the Scriptures is this: First God is supreme, worthy, holy, loving and He condescends to be our God.
                    Second, we are to be His holy people, living in a way that is worthy of His magnificence so that He
                    will live among us – for living among us He blesses us in every way. Third, we are to model and
                    message this blessing to every people group on earth. This is the covenant with our father Abraham:
                    we are blessed to be a blessing to every people group on earth. We were blessed (with the presence
                    of Jesus) for this. We were made for this – to extend the glory of God in all the earth, among every
                    people.
                    <br><br>
                    This is why Israel was referred to in the Old Testament as God’s special treasure to be a light for
                    all nations – we were made for this. This is why the Spirit was poured out at Pentecost including on
                    Arabs and Cretans and North Africans and Turks – we were made to spread the gospel. This is why the
                    church that prays for missions and gives sacrificially to see the gospel go where God is not
                    glorified is the church that God blesses – we were made for this.
                    <br><br>
                    We were made to glorify God and enjoy Him forever – it is the chief end of man. We were made to be a
                    holy habitation for the great God who humbles Himself to tabernacle among us and bless us. We were
                    made to proclaim this loving and merciful God to all nations. We were made to be the missionary
                    people of a missionary God. We can rebel against the very concept of being created, we can resent
                    that we have the most joy when we fulfil the Creator’s purpose – but that is just foolish arrogance.
                    How much better to humbly rejoice in God’s wisdom for us, lift up our eyes to treasuring Jesus among
                    the nations and shout <b>“We were made for this!”</b>

                <h2>Day 1</h2>
                <div class="devo-title">We were made for this: Part 1</div>
                <div class="devo-author">Steve and Natalie Overturf</div>
                <p>
                    When our daughter was born we sent out the following verse on her birth announcement:
                    <br>
                    "For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand,
                    that we should walk in them." Ephesians 2:10
                    <br><br>
                    When we look at a baby, it's easy to be full of anticipation and hopes of all that may be ahead.
                    Sadly, along the way, many of us forget that we have been created with a God ordained purpose, a
                    purpose and plan for us daily! Sometimes it can be easier perhaps to believe this on a broad "God
                    has a plan for my life" way, forgetting that he has purposes for us in each moment and circumstance.
                    <br><br>
                    We tend to drift from this reality most easily when we focus on ourselves--everything we are
                    not--instead of focusing on who He is! We begin determining what the works we should be doing by our
                    giftings, preferences and enniagram results rather than the simplicity of availability, surrender,
                    and willingness. Knowing our strengths and gifts can be helpful tools, but should not be the primary
                    filter by which we know what God is leading us to do.
                    <br><br>
                    Perhaps you have a desire to fulfill God's purpose for you, but you fight feelings of being
                    inadequate, unworthy, or apathetic--take heart! 2 Corinthians 4:7 talks about how when we are weak
                    (jars of clay) it is all the more evident that the grace and power by which we do the things God has
                    led us to do is from Him, not us.... He gets even more glory!
                    <br><br>
                    We've been created to worship, to know Christ and make him known. What holds us back from fulfilling
                    this purpose? As we take even the smallest of steps, he rushes to meet us. Like Esther, he has
                    uniquely positioned us for such a time as this (Esther 4:14). If is imperative that we are mindful
                    that as the Christians of this generation, we are responsible for this generation of souls! (Keith
                    Green) The reality that those around us who are not in Christ are destined for hell should trouble
                    us deeply. The reality that many more have not even had the opportunity to hear the Gospel even more
                    so...Jesus have mercy and awaken us.
                    <br><br>
                    When our focus is on Him (not ourselves) what is in His heart becomes what is on ours and we will
                    find it impossible to be apathetic or passive--but instead rising to action. Praying, sending,
                    going--across the street and around the globe.
                    <br><br>
                    Daily, as we posture ourselves as willing vessels, we can be sure He delights to have us join him in
                    what He's doing all around us and in doing what He's prepared for us to do. How often do we miss it
                    in our busyness and self-focus? In humble surrender, let us ask Father to help us see each day what
                    He has for us. Ask for fresh eyes to see what He sees and to swiftly respond to the prompting of the
                    Spirit. We will find ourselves knowing Him and making him known, the purpose for which we were
                    created. We were made for this!
