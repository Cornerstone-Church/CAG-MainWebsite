            <p>ALIVE Children’s Ministry believes every child is created uniquely in the image of Christ.
                Our goal is to teach children to understand how much God loves them and wants to have a forever
                relationship with them. Children are also encouraged to find and develop their talents to serve others,
                both at Cornerstone and in the community.<br><br>
                The ALIVE Children’s Ministry team partners with parents to build a child’s spiritual foundation so that
                it will endure. </p>

                                    Children, grades 1 through 5, will experience services that are relevant to their
                                    lives and presented in a creative format where children of all learning styles are

                                    meet with God. This is their church service.

                                    During 2nd Service, children ages three through Kindergarten come together for

                                    through story time, worship, puppetry, and crafts.

                                are structured to give each child the opportunity to ask questions and be mentored by
                                small group leaders. They also include time for crafts and games, as well as teaching

                            <p>The Nursery ministry begins with the youngest infant through children who are two years
                                old. Children are cared for in an atmosphere of love with music-filled lessons and a
                                loving team of servant ministers. Nursery ministry is provided during both Sunday
                                morning services as well as during our Wednesday evening classes. Parents whose children
                                attend our Nursery ministry on a regular basis are asked to join with us in caring for
                                our young ones at least one service a month. The Nursery is located is to the right of
                                the Sanctuary at the end of the hall.</p>

                            <p>The safety of every child is important. We provide a computerized check-in system which
                                ensures only authorized people can pick up a child. When checking a child in to
                                ministry, the parent will be given a parent pick-up tag with a number that matches the
                                number on the child’s name tag. The parent must present the parent pick-up tag to the
                                security team to enter the Children’s Center. The tag can be torn in two so that two
                                people can have access at separate times if needed. Children must be escorted to and
                                from class by their parent, guardian or sibling over the age of 14.<br><br>

                                Registration opens fifteen minutes prior to the start of service and closes at 9:15 am
                                for 1st Service, 11:15 am for 2nd Service, and 7:15 pm on Wednesdays.</p>
