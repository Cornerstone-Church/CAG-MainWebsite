                            Everyone will experience some type of loss during their lifetime. Loss comes in many forms:
                            death, loss of a job, loss of freedom, loss of a relationship and various other types of
                            losses. This small group study covers a multitude of losses that create pain in a person's
                            life. The course goal common to every lesson is to identify troublesome areas of the losses
                            and disappointments of life and to deal with them in constructive ways.
