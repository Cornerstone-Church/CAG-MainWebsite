            <p>As men, God has called us to both serve and lead in the body of Christ, in our families, at work and in
                the communities He’s placed us in. God has called you to do things that only you can do – things that
                matter for his Kingdom. We are seeking to build an authentic community, lift up Jesus, grow in Him and
                touch our world through a host of opportunities for men to learn, grow, serve and be used for the
                Kingdom.</p>

                            <p>Men gather to study God’s Word and discuss their faith together. Topics vary throughout

                                Wednesday nights begin with gathering in the sanctuary for community worship and then
                                we break for classes located in the lower building.
