                                This course will introduce you to the basic teachings of Islam, and offer a biblical

                                Arab Muslim world, and loves Muslims very much.

                            <p>This class is a study of the Book of James which encourages believers to put their faith
                                into action. The letter could be considered a how-to book on Christian living.
                                Confrontation, challenges, and a call to commitment awaits us in this study. It is easy
                                to say we have faith, but true faith will produce loving actions toward others. Come
                                let's explore together.</p>

                                This 9-session small group curriculum is designed to help people strengthen their
                                relationship with their heavenly Father by applying His names to their personal life.
                                Along with helping Christians know God better, it can serve as an evangelistic tool by
                                giving a true picture of God to people who may have a distorted view of Him because of
                                an absent or abusive earthly father who did not or does not provide for them. This group
                                can also help men who want to be better fathers.
                            </p>
