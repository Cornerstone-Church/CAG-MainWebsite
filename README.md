# CAG-MainWebsite
Welcome to CAG's main website repository. Thank you for being apart of something that will touch many people for the glory of God! Please read everything below to get started.

## Guide Lines to Follow (Subject for Change)
Here are some guide lines to follow that will help you get started and also help us as a team to work together!
 - WIP

## Structure
### Branches
 - "bleeding": The main branch servant ministers should be connected with. SUBMIT ALL CODE TO THIS!!!
 - "freeze": Code taken from bleeding to be bug tested and finilized.
 - "master": Holds project details like this readme.
 - "release": Code live on site.

## How to get started
### Recommended Software
The nice thing about code is that its flexable. And us a programmers like flexibility!! So feel free to use whatever IDE you please but I will post what I use here.
- IDE: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Plugins: Live Server, HTMLS CSS Support, Material Icon Theme
- Git: Git obviously ;)

### Get Code
1. Clone into repository: git clone https://github.com/Cornerstone-Church/CAG-MainWebsite.git
2. Change branch to "bleeding": git checkout bleeding
3. Start editing!
 
## Upload to repository
 - Make sure you are in "bleeding". Pushes to other branches is not allowed!
1. Add all changes to git: git add -A
2. Commit changes with a description: git commit -m "REQUIRED DESCRIPTION HERE"
3. Push updated code to repository: git push

## Request branch upgrade
Code uploaded to the "bleeding" branch does not automaticaly get uploaded to the web servers. In order for code to be moved to the next level (like "freeze") you must create a Pull Request.
1. Click Pull Request on GitHub repository site.
2. Click "New pull request".
3. Choose your branch changes ("freeze" <- "bleeding").
4. Name your request with a description.
NOTE: Requests without a description will most likly not be approved.
5. Submit and wait for approval from an admin.
