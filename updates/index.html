                <p>
                    Dear Cornerstone Church Family,

                    <br><br>This coming Sunday, June 21 is Father’s Day. Cornerstone is blessed with so many wonderful men of
                    God. We are thankful for the godly dads who proclaim Jesus with their mouths and with their lives.

                    <br><br>Dads, you are so important to the life of your family and to our church. Whether you are a physical
                    father or a spiritual father, we want you to know we are praying for each one of you. We’re asking
                    God to bless you with His presence and His joy in new and greater ways. As a special thank you, we
                    have a gift for each one of you. Please come by the church to pick up your gift at the Welcome
                    Center during our regular office hours on Monday through Thursday at 8:30am - 4:30pm or on Friday at
                    8:30am - 3pm.

                    <br><br>We are very excited to announce that our first time of gathering together will be this Saturday
                    night, June 20 at 7pm for our “In the Gap” prayer meeting. We invite you to join us in person, but
                    you must register at cag.org/events prior to the service to attend. We are limited to 150 people, so
                    please register soon. If you are unable to attend in person, join us online on the Cornerstone
                    Facebook page. Thanks for praying with us.

                    <br><br>Also, please be sure to watch online at cag.org this week as we continue our “Welcome Home” series
                    with a Father’s Day message called “The Father Heart of God.” You won’t want to miss the very
                    special video that is part of this week’s message. Please join us at 9am and 11am and be sure to
                    share the service with others.

                    <br><br>Together for Jesus,

                    <br>Pastor Mark

                <p>
                    Dear Cornerstone Family,
                    <br><br>
                    Thank you for your perseverance and your heart for God. You have been faithful to love, serve, and
                    touch
                    others during this time of not being able to gather together. You have modeled faithfulness and have
                    pressed in through prayer. Prayer has always been the key to Cornerstone Church. Like never before,
                    prayer is essential.
                    <br><br>
                    Just last week, we received news that some restrictions are lifting in Prince George’s County. This
                    will
                    allow us to meet in person in smaller numbers. We are very excited to announce our first time of
                    gathering together will be this Saturday night, June 20 at 7pm for our “In the Gap” prayer meeting.
                    We
                    invite you to join us in person, but you must register online at cag.org/events. Since we are
                    limited to
                    150 people this week, please register soon. If you are unable to attend in person, join us online on
                    the
                    Cornerstone Facebook page. Thanks for praying with us.
                    <br><br>

                <h3>March 14th, 2020</h3>
                <p>Dear Cornerstone Family,
                    <br><br>
                    “For He will rescue you from every trap and protect you from deadly disease. He will cover you with
                    His
                    feathers. He will shelter you with His wings. His faithful promises are your armor and protection.”
                    Psalm 91:3-4
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Don’t Be Afraid, Trust God</b>
                    <br>
                    “Do not be afraid of the terrors of the night, nor the arrow that flies in the day. Do not dread the
                    disease that stalks in darkness, nor the disaster that strikes at midday.” Verse 5-6
                    <br><br>
                    I am so thankful that in the midst of any storm, our God is a shelter, a refuge, and a place of
                    safety.
                    We can put all of our trust in Him, and depend on Him alone. Fear is not how God made us to live. We
                    are
                    people of faith and trust in our powerful God. My prayer for you is that you and your families will
                    breath in His peace and let your faith in God rise up like never before.
                    <br><br>
                    We are praying for each one of you and are asking God for His protection, His healing, His keeping
                    power
                    and also His presence to overwhelm you. We all are putting our trust in the living God during this
                    time
                    for all that are impacted by COVID-19 and its effects.
                    <br><br>
                    I want to encourage you while many of us are at home or are curtailing other activities to put God
                    first. Let’s pray and see God answer and move in lives and hearts, and in the nations. Most of you
                    have
                    seen the video we released on Thursday, but if you have not, you can view it
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/Clxba9HYSj4" target="_blank">here</a>.
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                <b>What Should We Be Praying For?</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pray for healing for those who have the Coronavirus: Our God is the Healer!</li>
                    <li>Pray for protection against the virus: He will protect You!</li>
                    <li>Pray for God to stop the spread of the virus: If His people will pray then God will heal our
                        land!</li>
                    <li>Pray for people to turn to God: Many people are looking now for answers, the only one is Jesus!
                    </li>
                    <li>Pray that God would make us witnesses of His grace: We can be His witnesses of peace and hope!
                    </li>
                    <li>Pray for other brothers and sisters around the World: Many nations are suffering much more than
                        we are.</li>
                    <li>Pray for our missionaries around the nation and the World: Pray that God will protect them,
                        provide for them, and use them.</li>
                    <li>Pray for Cornerstone Church: For all the people who call Cornerstone their home, pray that God
                        will use us to touch others for Jesus during this time and beyond.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <b>How Should We Take Precaution?</b>
                <br>
                Your well-being and safety matters to us. With that in mind, we encourage you to take precautions to
                keep yourself and others safe. You can help stop the spread of the virus in the following ways:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the
                        bathroom, before eating and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
                    <li>Cover your sneeze or cough with a tissue or your arm.</li>
                    <li>Avoid touching your face.</li>
                    <li>If you are returning from a high-alert area, we urge you to refrain from attending church
                        events, classes, small groups and services until the 14-day time-frame has been observed.</li>
                    <li>If you or someone you know tests positive for COVID-19, please let us know so we can find a way
                        to help, pray for everyone involved and take any necessary precautions here at Cornerstone
                        Church.</li>
                    <li>Anyone, especially if you have a weak immunity, above the age of 60 should avoid non-essential
                        events.</li>
                    <li>Avoid attending church events, classes, small groups and services if you are feeling ill or have
                        been around someone not feeling well.</li>
                    <li>Practice social distancing. Stay at least 6 feet apart and avoid large crowds.</li>
                </ul>

                <b>Cornerstone’s Role</b>
                <br>
                Here are things that we are doing at Cornerstone Church. Our Governor has asked that all gatherings of
                more than 250 people be stopped for this time, so our staff has met together and have put these things
                in place.
                <ul>

                    Together we are trusting God. As a family, we will see the Lord’s faithfulness to us and through us
                    during this challenging time. None of this has taken God by surprise, so let’s lean on Jesus and see
                    His
                    hand guiding us. Trust Him and believe!
                    <br><br>
                    The Lord says, “I will rescue those who love me. I will protect those who trust in my name. When
                    they
                    call on me, I will answer; I will be with them in trouble. I will rescue and honor them.” Psalm
                    91:14-15
                    <br><br>
                    Together for Jesus,
                    <br><br>
