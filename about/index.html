                        <h1>About the Bible</h1>
                        <p>
                            We believe that the Bible is fully inspired by God, that it is entirely trustworthy and is
                            our guide for faith and life.
                            <br><br><i>All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting
                                and training
                                in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good
                                work. (2 Timothy 3:16)</i>

                    <li>
                        <h1>About God</h1>
                        <p>
                            We believe that God is the loving Creator of all that exists, both seen and unseen. God is
                            eternal and completely good, knowing all things, having all power and majesty. God exists
                            eternally as the Trinity, in three persons, yet one God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

                            <br><br><i>Do you not know? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God, the
                                Creator of the
                                ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can
                                fathom. Isaiah 40:28/ Genesis 1:1-31)</i>

                    <li>
                        <h1>About Jesus</h1>
                        <p>
                            We believe Jesus was born of the virgin Mary and lived a sinless life. We believe He was
                            crucified for the sins of us all, rose again from the dead and ascended to heaven.

                            <br><br><i>Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in
                                me will
                                live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you
                                believe this?” (John 11:25-26)</i>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h1>About the Holy Spirit</h1>
                        <p>
                            We believe that the Holy Spirit, sent from God to live in all who believe in Jesus,
                            teaches, comforts, and empowers us, giving each follower of Jesus diverse gifts for serving
                            in the church and serving others in the world. We believe that it is through the Holy
                            Spirit that we change and develop a holy life and Jesus-like character.

                            <br><br><i>But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my
                                witnesses
                                in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. (Acts
                                1:8).</i>
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <h1>About Salvation</h1>
                        <p>
                            We believe that all people are created with dignity and great value in the image of God. We
                            are created to live in a thriving relationship with God. However, through our sin (failing
                            to live by God’s moral standards), we break our intended relationship with God and we
                            experience the sad consequences of that broken relationship, but because of God’s love for
                            us, He sent His Son, Jesus, to rescue us from those consequences and to restore our broken
                            relationship with God, through Jesus´ death on the cross. We can receive the free gift of
                            forgiveness and can be made new when we put our faith in Him.

                            <br><br><i>For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever
                                believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. (John 3:16)</i>
                        </p>

                        <h1>About the Church</h1>
                        <p>
                            We believe that the church is comprised of any person, anywhere in the world who puts faith
                            in Jesus. The church itself is people who are empowered by God’s Spirit to be part of the
                            mission of Jesus here on earth. The church is one global community, but has smaller, local
                            expressions, such as Cornerstone. Each local church expression has a unique personality and
                            we see beauty in that diversity. We believe that the church does not exist for itself, but
                            exists as a community of worshipers who are here to serve others, as we bring the love and
                            hope of Jesus to the world around us.

                            <br><br><i>Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens
                                with God’s
                                people and also members of his household, built on the foundation of the apostles and
                                prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone. (Ephesians 2:19-20)</i>

                        <h1>About the Afterlife and End Times</h1>
                        <p>
                            We believe there are a literal heaven and hell and that one day Jesus will return, although
                            we approach the topics of the afterlife and end times with great mystery and wonder.

                            <br><br><i>Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above,
                                where
                                Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on
                                earthly
                                things. For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. When Christ, who
                                is
                                your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory. (Colossians 3:1-4)</i>

                        <h1>Divine Healing</h1>
                        <p>
                            Wherever Jesus went, He ministered with compassion and healed the sick. Christ’s example
                            showed an interconnection with salvation as many believed following their healing.

                            <br><br><i>Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the
                                good news of
                                the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people. (Matthew 4:23)</i>

                            <br><br>Our Lord continues to heal today and it is vital that the church preach, teach and
                            practice
                            this biblical truth. Scriptures command believers to pray in faith and trust God for the
                            outcome.

                            <br><br><i>He himself bore our sins in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins
                                and live
                                for righteousness; “by his wounds you have been healed.” (Peter 2:24)</i>
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <h1>Empowerment of the Holy Spirit</h1>
                        <p>
                            The doctrine of the Baptism in the Holy Spirit is our distinctive. This truth explains the
                            passion and power of our witness. Jesus promised His followers they would receive power
                            from on high so that they would be His witnesses. We believe this truth is just as relevant
                            today as our Fellowship continues to take the gospel message around the globe.

                            <br><br><i>Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus
                                Christ for
                                the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. (Acts
                                2:38)</i>

                        <h1>The Second Coming</h1>
                        <p>
                            With the world experiencing natural disasters, economic downturns, and increasing
                            uncertainties on many fronts, the doctrine of Christ’s Second Coming is more relevant than
                            ever. Believers must rest in the certainty of the imminent return of our Lord, live their
                            lives in view of this, and share this hope with others.

                            <br><br><i>Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to
                                be? You
                                ought to live holy and godly lives as you look forward to the day of God and speed its
                                coming. That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the
                                elements
                                will melt in the heat. But in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new
                                heaven and a new earth, where righteousness dwells (2 Peter 3:11-13)</i>
