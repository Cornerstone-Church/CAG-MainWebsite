                    <h1>About the Bible</h1>
                    <p>
                        We believe that the Bible is fully inspired by God, that it is entirely trustworthy and is
                        our guide for faith and life.
                        <br><br><i>All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting
                            and training
                            in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good
                            work. (2 Timothy 3:16)</i>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h1>About God</h1>
                    <p>
                        We believe that God is the loving Creator of all that exists, both seen and unseen. God is
                        eternal and completely good, knowing all things, having all power and majesty. God exists
                        eternally as the Trinity, in three persons, yet one God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

                        <br><br><i>Do you not know? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God, the
                            Creator of the
                            ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can
                            fathom. Isaiah 40:28/ Genesis 1:1-31)</i>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h1>About Jesus</h1>
                    <p>
                        We believe Jesus was born of the virgin Mary and lived a sinless life. We believe He was
                        crucified for the sins of us all, rose again from the dead and ascended to heaven.

                        <br><br><i>Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in
                            me will
                            live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you
                            believe this?” (John 11:25-26)</i>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h1>About the Holy Spirit</h1>
                    <p>
                        We believe that the Holy Spirit, sent from God to live in all who believe in Jesus,
                        teaches, comforts, and empowers us, giving each follower of Jesus diverse gifts for serving
                        in the church and serving others in the world. We believe that it is through the Holy
                        Spirit that we change and develop a holy life and Jesus-like character.

                        <br><br><i>But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my
                            witnesses
                            in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. (Acts
                            1:8).</i>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h1>About Salvation</h1>
                    <p>
                        We believe that all people are created with dignity and great value in the image of God. We
                        are created to live in a thriving relationship with God. However, through our sin (failing
                        to live by God’s moral standards), we break our intended relationship with God and we
                        experience the sad consequences of that broken relationship, but because of God’s love for
                        us, He sent His Son, Jesus, to rescue us from those consequences and to restore our broken
                        relationship with God, through Jesus´ death on the cross. We can receive the free gift of
                        forgiveness and can be made new when we put our faith in Him.

                        <br><br><i>For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever
                            believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. (John 3:16)</i>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h1>About the Church</h1>
                    <p>
                        We believe that the church is comprised of any person, anywhere in the world who puts faith
                        in Jesus. The church itself is people who are empowered by God’s Spirit to be part of the
                        mission of Jesus here on earth. The church is one global community, but has smaller, local
                        expressions, such as Cornerstone. Each local church expression has a unique personality and
                        we see beauty in that diversity. We believe that the church does not exist for itself, but
                        exists as a community of worshipers who are here to serve others as we bring the love and
                        hope of Jesus to the world around us.

                        <br><br><i>Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens
                            with God’s
                            people and also members of his household, built on the foundation of the apostles and
                            prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone. (Ephesians 2:19-20)</i>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h1>About the Afterlife and End Times</h1>
                    <p>
                        We believe there is a literal heaven and hell and that one day Jesus will return, although
                        we approach the topics of the afterlife and end times with great mystery and wonder.

                        <br><br><i>Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above,
                            where
                            Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on
                            earthly
                            things. For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. When Christ, who
                            is
                            your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory. (Colossians 3:1-4)</i>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h1>Divine Healing</h1>
                    <p>
                        Wherever Jesus went, He ministered with compassion and healed the sick. Christ’s example
                        showed an interconnection with salvation as many believed following their healing.

                        <br><br><i>Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the
                            good news of
                            the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people. (Matthew 4:23)</i>

                        <br><br>Our Lord continues to heal today and it is vital that the church preach, teach and
                        practice
                        this biblical truth. Scriptures command believers to pray in faith and trust God for the
                        outcome.

                        <br><br><i>He himself bore our sins in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins
                            and live
                            for righteousness; “by his wounds you have been healed.” (Peter 2:24)</i>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h1>Empowerment of the Holy Spirit</h1>
                    <p>
                        The doctrine of the Baptism in the Holy Spirit is our distinctive. This truth explains the
                        passion and power of our witness. Jesus promised His followers they would receive power
                        from on high so that they would be His witnesses. We believe this truth is just as relevant
                        today as our Fellowship continues to take the gospel message around the globe.

                        <br><br><i>Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus
                            Christ for
                            the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. (Acts
                            2:38)</i>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h1>The Second Coming</h1>
                    <p>
                        With the world experiencing natural disasters, economic downturns, and increasing
                        uncertainties on many fronts, the doctrine of Christ’s Second Coming is more relevant than
                        ever. Believers must rest in the certainty of the imminent return of our Lord, live their
                        lives in view of this, and share this hope with others.

                        <br><br><i>Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to
                            be? You
                            ought to live holy and godly lives as you look forward to the day of God and speed its
                            coming. That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the
                            elements
                            will melt in the heat. But in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new
                            heaven and a new earth, where righteousness dwells (2 Peter 3:11-13)</i>
