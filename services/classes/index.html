                    <h3>Room 101</h3>
                    <p>
                        Buddhism is an ancient spiritual belief that blinds people to the saving knowledge of Jesus
                        Christ. Come and learn about the history of Buddhism, its beliefs, its presence around the world
                        and its growth in the West. More importantly, learn how we can reach those lost in the darkness
                        of "enlightenment".

                        that occurred testifying to God’s continuing work among His people. Learn about the different
                        kings reigning in both Israel and Judah as we explore almost 300 years of different monarchies.
                        This class is facilitated in sign language.
