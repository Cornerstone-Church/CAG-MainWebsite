                            This study focuses on Paul’s systematic explanation of the gospel to the Romans and offers
                            insight into the doctrines of sin, salvation, and sanctification. The student will learn how
                            union with Christ and the indwelling Holy Spirit leads to spiritual growth.

                        This is a 12-week study intended to motivate three things: Awareness of our role as God's
                        Remnant, United Prayer, and Intentional Godly Living. Join us as we explore Ezekiel's vision,
                        Isaiah's call, and specific ways we can live godly, intentional lives in these dark days; taking
                        it all to God's Throne Room weekly.

                        In I Declare War, Levi Lusko identifies four weapons you have at your disposal—thoughts, words,
                        behaviors, and power—and illustrates how to use them to achieve ongoing victory. It’s time to
                        stop being your own worst enemy. Declare war and become the person, the spouse, the parent, and
                        the leader God intended you to be.
