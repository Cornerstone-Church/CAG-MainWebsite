                    <h3>Room 101</h3>
                    <p>
                        From the moment the first woman came face to face with the serpent, Satan has been a liar. The
                        whispered twisted truths and outright lies that bombard women, daily, have a way of sinking in
                        and becoming accepted, wrong core beliefs. These beliefs hold us back, tear us down, and keep us
                        from pursuing, the abundant life God tells us we have in Him. Join with other women as we
                        discover who God tells us we are versus the lies from the world.
