                        For married couples or those who are thinking about marriage. Understand marriage as a covenant
                        commitment first to God, then to one another. “Though one may be overpowered, two can defend
                        themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.”- Ecclesiastes 4:12 (NIV)

                    <p>
                        In this study, author and teacher Priscilla Shirer helps women discover the root to clear and
                        daily communication with God—humble obedience. Learn how surrender unlocks His many blessings

                    <p>
                        From the miraculous crossing of the Jordan to the crash of the walls of Jericho, the book of
                        Joshua is full of examples of God’s faithfulness and promises. Join us as we learn how to walk
                        in obedience to God and persevere in our own daily challenges. This class is facilitated in sign
                        language.

                    <h2>Spiritual Disciplines - The Habits of Relationship</h2>
                    <h3>Room 103</h3>
                    <p>
                        Spiritual disciplines are really habits of relationship rather than religious duties or routine.
                        Cultivating habits of relationship with God and others will help us go deeper in Him and
                        increase the effectiveness of living for Him.

                    <h3>Room 105</h3>
                    <p>
                        Jesus only lived 33 years, but no other life has had an impact on society like His life. In this
                        class, men will journey together into what authentic manhood really looks like and how we can
                        have a lasting and positive impact on those around us.
