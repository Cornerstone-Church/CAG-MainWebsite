                Obituary</b>
            </div>
            <p>
                Richard (Dick) F. Brown of Bowie, MD passed away on August 15, 2020 in a Pasco County, FL hospital of
                complications following heart surgery, at the age of 87. Born to the late John S. & Annetta M. (Metzger)
                Brown in Philadelphia, PA on September 7, 1932. Dick graduated from Myerstown High School in 1950 and joined
                the Navy one month later. During his 3 years of service, he served aboard the USS Mattabesset and the USS
                Salamonie and was honorably discharged in July 1953.<br><br>
                Dick joined the Air Force in January 1954 and married the lovely Luanne Mae Werner later that year on August
                28, 1954. He served in the Air Force for 18 years and was honorably discharged as a Senior Master Sergeant
                on December 31, 1972. He immediately joined the U.S. Capitol Police on January 3, 1973 and after serving 20
                years on the force, he retired yet again, on January 31, 1993. He promptly joined the U.S. Marshal Service
                as a Deputy U.S. Marshal assigned to the Department of Justice for roughly 12 years before his reassignment
                to the Department of Homeland Security where he served an additional 2 years before being disabled by a
                stroke in July, 2007.<br><br>
                While 55 years of service to his country are to be admired and applauded, it was his love of, and dedication
                to, his Savior, Jesus Christ, and to his family that always came first. Throughout their almost 66 years of
                marriage, Dick and Luanne raised 10 children and fostered countless infants as they awaited their forever
                homes.<br><br>
                Cornerstone Assemblies of God Church in Bowie is where Dick and Luanne anchored themselves to God’s call on
                their lives to actively pursue Christ’s command from Matthew 28:19 “Therefore go and make disciples of all
                nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit…”. Missions
                throughout the world, their children, grandchildren and great grandchildren were always at the top of their
                prayer lives.<br><br>
                Dick is survived by his wife, Luanne (Werner), his 10 children, Steven (Shellaine), Roxanne (Kevin), Cathy
                (Stephen), Lori (Jeffrey), Virginia (Daniel), Matthew (Maria Jose), Bruce (Jennie), Mark, Michael (Amanda),
                Kimberly; his 28 grandchildren, Tricia (Benjamin), Kelly (Brandon), Benjamin (Andrea), Christopher, Lauren
                (Daniel), Lindsay, Tyler (Mayrelis), Connor (Leah), Reese, Joseph (Erica), Sarah (Christopher), Samantha,
                Paige, Jack, Emma, Hope, Grace, Adela, Nathan, Jacob, Nicolas, Riley, Reagan, A’Miya, Mekhi, Leila, Bradyn,
                Keira; and his 18 great grandchildren, Caleb, Bella, Yenifer, Merci, Asher, Zimri, Noa, Sylvia, Solomon,
                Jovie, Reagan, Isaiah, Levi, Audrey, Zoey, Olivia, Linden, and Sophia. He is also survived by a
                sister-in-law, a brother-in-law, numerous nieces, nephews, grandnieces and a grandnephew.<br><br>
                Dick was pre-deceased by his brother, John S. Brown, Jr., and his sister, Margaret (Brown) Fink.<br><br>
                In lieu of flowers, the family has requested donations be made in his honor through <a href="https://kingdominvestors.info" target="_blank">kingdominvestors.info</a>.
